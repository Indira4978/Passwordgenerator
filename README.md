# Acknowledgements
I used several sources to help me with this project such as Youtube - to review functions, books such as "Java Script for dummies by Chris Minnick.
I used the help of TA and I also used chat GPT to help me with the debugging and ask specific questions such as "when to use push vs concat".
I think the app doe not run exactly as I wish it to and I will get back to it when I feel more confident with JS functions.
